# Freecodecamp Rational Databases

Storage of my classes and projects from the freecodecamp course: Rational Databases. It is a great free online course of studying PostgreSQL! 

From freecodecamp:
For these courses, you will use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

I won't store all of the class here, so are particularly basic but the more challenge class, definitely, and the projects.
